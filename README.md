# ImageSlider
This is a simple image gallery which takes an array of images url and creates interactive gallery allowing for switching back and forth between images. It takes the image and creates a background so that it is not an empty space but rather transformed foreground image in a same style as vertically recorded videos are shown on TV. 
All this is done with a vannila JS, CSS & HTML. 
Webpack was used.
